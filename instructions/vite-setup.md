# Creating a React app

### Change into the folder containing your projects

```
cd <directory>
```

### Enter the following command

```
npm create vite@latest <your-app-name> -- --template react
```

### If you see the following output, enter y and then press enter

```
Need to install the following packages:
  create-vite@5.X.X
Ok to proceed? (y)
```

### Once the command has executed, it should output the next steps for you to follow

```
cd <your-app-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

To link your local project directory to a GitHub repo, create a new empty repo on GitHub then follow the instructions in the new repoâ€™s page to connect it to your local project directory.

### Using an existing repo

Alternatively, if you created a GitHub repo already and cloned it, you can cd into your cloned repo then run the above Vite command, using . as the project name

```
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react
```

This will tell Vite to use the current directory for the project, instead of creating a new directory with the given project name. This cloned directory will already be initialized as a git repo and connected to the right remote.
